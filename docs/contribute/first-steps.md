# First steps

## Read the contributing guide

**Before you start coding**, read the repository’s **CONTRIBUTING.md** for the full workflow and expectations:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Daniel-Gia/raspberry-pi-chromium-kiosk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)


## New here
If you’re new here, start small:

- Fix a typo or improve a doc page
- Report a bug with steps to reproduce
- Suggest a feature with a clear use case

## Before you start

- Check existing issues/PRs first to avoid duplicates.
- If you’re unsure about the best approach, open an issue to discuss it before writing code.
